# NucleotideMSA-Assignment
In this assignment, I had to create an application to work on nucleotide multiple sequence alignments (MSA). This will be done in a team context. The team exists of 3 roles: the team leader, the bio informatician and the technical support. The bio informaticians work on their respective MSA. The team leader manages the team and can write an alignment to the repository. The technical support can clear, make a backup and restore the repository.

Since this is a school project, a built out scenario is already provided in the `StartUp` class.

The application is a command line application, no GUI is provided.
